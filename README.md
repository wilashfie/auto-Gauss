# auto-Gauss

Routine to fit six Gaussians to a Si IV 1402.77 Å spectral line profile. Accounts for the following components:

1. Main (central) Emission
2. Red-wing Emisison 
3. Stationary Emission
4. Stationary Absorbtion 
5. Fe II at 1403.10 Å
6. Fe II at 1403.13 Å

Fit will return best combination of these six-Gaussians.
